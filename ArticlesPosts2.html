                            <p>I have interviewed countless amount of people for various roles over the years and the most important thing I look into is the attitude of the person, and then I will look into skills. This fundamental criteria applies to fresh graduates and junior executives.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>However, when it comes to those who have at least 3 years of experience, the weightage of consideration shifts heavily towards skills and experience. Because with the years of experience, it would have reflected how well a person perform and grow in an organization. Well, the word "experience" does not mean I am going to ask you how many years of experience do you have on specific area of skills. Rather, it is more about gauging if you have the skills and knowledge in respect to your years of experience.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>What really bothers me is that there is too many candidates that I have interviewed do not possess the skills and experience they should have with the years of experience they have. This is when there will be a gap between the salary expectation of the candidate and the value they bring to organizations. This eventually results in candidate rejections by the hiring manager. Well, you may say that, why not offering lesser than the candidate's expectation? Some may consider it. But it frustrates us to think why does this candidate remained stagnant over the years.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>So the question is, why does this happen to so many people? Often times, this happens when one is not actively seek for professional growth or not even conscious about it. They spent years working just to deliver their work, but not actively learning new things and seek new challenges.</p>

                                        <li>Set goals on skills you would like to master in your profession and seek for your mentor's or your manager's guidance. Have a check-in every month to monitor your progress. You can also set goals based on your career goals and work on items that will get you there.</li>

                                        <li>Be curious and embrace uncertainties. Whenever you find yourself discovering things you do not have knowledge on, Google it. You can make learnings light by doing mini research and read short articles about things you do not know. Do not let ignorance be in your way of progress.</li>

                                        <li>Get out of your comfort zone. You may try volunteering yourself to a challenging project. The fundamental mindset to acquire is to embrace failure because failures expose you to tremendous learning process.</li>

                                        <li>Constantly reflect on the way you work and figure out a way to do it better. This will prevent you from staying stagnant and getting into the trap of "this is how I have always done it". There will always be a better way and we should always be able to adapt. This may also applies to processes and practices in your workplace. Figure out the pain points or ineffective areas and work from there. Learning how to get things done the better way will help you think creatively. At the same time, if you do a lot of research, you will keep yourself up to trend with the industry's current best practices.</li>
