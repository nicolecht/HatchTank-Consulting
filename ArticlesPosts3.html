                            <p style="text-align:justify;">I try to conduct reviews with my team members as often as I can. And when I do, it is not only about their performance, but also mine.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to get feedback or evaluated by your team members because that is the best way to know if you are performing up to your team members expectations. </p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify;">Why is it important to reflect on yourself as a leader? Because, how do you expect your team members to be at their best if you are not being the best for them?</p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify;">Because at the end of the day, you are not only responsible of delivering results, but also to support your team members to be the best version of themselves. </p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify;">More often than not, a team's performance is highly dependent on the leader of the team.</p>

                                <br>
                                <li>I ask questions that makes it easier for them to open up. For example, "How do you think I can improve to help you and the team work effectively?"</li>

                                <li>After receiving feedback, I will update them how are we going change things and eventually help the team work better together - and of course I would have to walk the talk.</li>
